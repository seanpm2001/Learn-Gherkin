Feature: Project language file 1
Scenario: Given "$name has opened this file" do |name|
  # Project language file 1
  # For: seanpm2001/Learn-Gherkin
  # About:
  # I decided to make Gherkin the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Gherkin) as Gherkin is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Gherkin programming language. It only makes sense to make Gherkin the official language for this project.
